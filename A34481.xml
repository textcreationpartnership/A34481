            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>HIS Royal Highneſs having parted from this place on <hi>Monday</hi> laſt, being called by the King to attend his Majeſty at <hi>Newmarket,</hi> we ſhould prove very defective in Duty and Gratitude, if upon this occaſion we ſhould forget to acknowledge to your Grace, how much this poor Church, and our Order, do owe to his Princely Care and Goodneſs; that his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, and the worthy Biſhops of <hi>England,</hi> may from you receive a juſt account thereof.</p>
            <p>Since the coming of his Royal Highneſs to this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, we find our caſe much changed for the better, and our Church and Order (which through the cunning and power of our Adverſaries, were expoſed to extream ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard and contempt) ſenſibly relieved, and reſcued; which next to the watchful Providence of God (that mercifully ſuperintends his Church,) we can aſcribe to nothing ſo much as to his Royal Highneſs gracious own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and vigilent protection of us:</p>
            <pb n="2" facs="tcp:30159:2" rendition="simple:additions"/>
            <p>Upon all occaſions he gives freſh inſtances of his Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Zeal againſt the moſt unreaſonable Schiſm, which by rending, threatens the Subverſion of our Church and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; and concerns himſelf as a Patron to us, in all our Publick, and even Private and Perſonal Intereſts: So that all may take notice of his ſignal kindneſs to us, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve that he looks on the Enemies of the Church as Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries to the Monarchy it ſelf: Nor did we ever pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe or offer to his Royal Highneſs any rational Expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, which might conduce to the Belief and Security of the Church which he did not readily embrace and effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuate.</p>
            <p>The Peace and Tranquility of this Kingdom is the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of his prudent and ſteady conduct of Affairs; and the humours of our wicked Fanaticks are much reſtrained from dangerous Eruptions: upon their apprehenſions of his Vigilance and Juſtice. For they dread nothing ſo much, as to ſee him upon the Head of his Majeſties Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions and Forces againſt them.</p>
            <p>We hope your Grace will make our dutiful Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgments to his Royal Highneſs for all his Princely Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to us, and give him the moſt firm aſſurance of our moſt ſincere Endeavours to ſerve him, and of our moſt fervent Prayers for his Temporal and Eternal Happineſs; as is the bounden duty of,</p>
